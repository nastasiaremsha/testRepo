All of our teas are purchased weekly from the growers and shipped to our Fukuoka, Japan based packaging facility where they are repacked into our own date-stamped oxygen free packaging, cold stored until dispatch, and then air-shipped to our customers directly from Japan.

    <p>Kettl began from a sincere desire to make the finest teas of Japan available to customers throughout the world. In 2010, after working for Japan's largest green tea company, owner Zach Mangan took a solo one month trip to Japan and realized immediately the freshest and most delicious products stay within Japan's domestic market. The supply chain in Japan is short and customers more often than not drink fresh, local tea. Driven by a simple to desire to shrink the supply chain and to connect these incredible teas with a wider audience, Zach began a two year process to develop relationships with several of Japan's most notable tea producers. Generally, the best teas come from rural, isolated areas of Japan where small volume and high demand make procuring them difficult - and if they have been available, keeping them fresh has not been a high priority. We saw this as an opportunity and challenge worth undertaking.</p>
